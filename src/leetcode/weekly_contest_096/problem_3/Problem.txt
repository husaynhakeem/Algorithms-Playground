Decoded String at Index

An encoded string S is given.  To find and write the decoded string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
If the character read is a digit (say d), the entire current tape is repeatedly written d-1 more times in total.
Now for some encoded string S, and an index K, find and return the K-th letter (1 indexed) in the decoded string.
