You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

    0 representing an empty cell,
    1 representing a fresh orange, or
    2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
