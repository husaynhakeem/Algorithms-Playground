Loop detection

Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.

Definition:
Circular linked list: A corrupt linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

Example:
Input: a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> c (The same c as earlier)
Output: c
