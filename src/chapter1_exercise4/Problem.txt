Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

Example:
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (Permutations: taco cat, atco cta, etc)
